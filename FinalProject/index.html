          <h2>The History of the New York Jets</h2>
          <p>
            The New York Jets, founded in 1960 as the Titans of New York, are one of the most storied franchises in the NFL. 
            In 1963, the team was renamed the Jets to reflect the city's excitement for air travel and its future home near LaGuardia Airport.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jets achieved their greatest triumph in 1969 when Joe Namath famously guaranteed and delivered a Super Bowl III victory over the Baltimore Colts. 
            Since then, the team has remained a symbol of resilience and passion, with a fanbase that proudly bleeds green and white.
          </p>
          <p>
            From iconic players like Joe Namath and Curtis Martin to modern stars like Aaron Rodgers and Garrett Wilson, the Jets continue to fight for glory on the gridiron.
